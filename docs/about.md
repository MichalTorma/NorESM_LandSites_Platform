# Platform for NorESM site-level simulation over land

doi: ***under construction***

## Overview and documentation
The platform aims to facilitate site-level simulations over land using [NorESM](https://github.com/NorESMhub/NorESM) and its land component [CTSM](https://github.com/NorESMhub/CTSM) with the developing vegetation demographic module [FATES](https://github.com/NGEET/fates). It provides **optimized model setup, input data and reproducible workflows for running the model and analyzing model output over sites** with meteorological, ecological and hydrological observations with minimal techincal obstacles.

The platform aims to bridge the gaps between observations and modelling, and **promote the usage of site-level observations to test, validate and improve NorESM** and its land component on the one hand, and **promote the usage of NorESM and its land model component by non-modellers** on the other hand.

The observation sites currently included in the platform are described in the [Land sites](https://noresmhub.github.io/noresm-land-sites-platform/land-sites/) section.

## How to cite
For now, cite the NorESM Land Sites Platform as: NorESM-LSP development team. 2022. The NorESM Land Sites Platform (Version v1) [Computer software]

Look for our upcoming technical description paper, which will provide a DOI and better citation practice.

## Acknowledgements
The NorESM-LSP has evolved over several years from the needs and visions of a large group of connected through the EMERALD and LATICE projects. Funding has come from the projects listed above. Thanks are due to everyone who participated along the way in discussions, feedback, and testing of early versions.

## Contact

For questions about the platform, please [open an issue](https://github.com/NorESMhub/noresm-land-sites-platform/issues/) on GitHub or get in touch with one of the code developers directly.
