The NorESM LandSites Platform is an initiative to facilitate use and development of the dynamic vegetation model [FATES](https://github.com/NGEET/fates) and the [Community Land Model](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/clm/) within the [Norwegian Earth System Model](https://www.noresm.org/)

Originating in the [EMERALD project](https://www.mn.uio.no/geo/english/research/projects/emerald/) from the idea of [Hui Tang9], it is under development by PhD students and postdocs connected to EMERALD.
