# Welcome to the documentation of the NorESM LandSites Platform

See our About page for an introduction to what this is.

The repository is stored [here](https://github.com/NorESMhub/NorESM_LandSites_Platform).

This is a way of using NorESM-CTSM/CLM-FATES. 

## How to use the platform

User guide coming. Customise your model runs with the Settings file.
So far the platform is on [NREC](https://nrec.no/), and an outdated prototype is available on [Galaxy](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/climate/tutorials/fates/tutorial.html). We have plans for making a better solution using Docker, which should be flexible for advanced users and at the same time easy to use for beginners.
