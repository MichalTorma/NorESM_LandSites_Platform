# External tutorials and resources

While the NorESM-LSP provides an easy interface to run model experiments with the NorESM-CLM-FATES models, interpreting the results and setting up high-quality simulations can be time-consuming and requires specialist knowledge about the models and theoretical knowledge of Earth System science. Here we collect some useful links to tutorials and other resources where you can learn more about the models. If you are new to modelling but want to publish something, it might be a good idea to reach out to someone who is more familiar with the models to find collaborators on your project. The model framework consists of the Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM), the Community Land Model (CLM), and the Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator (FATES). Each model has its own documentation and tutorials.

## Highlighted tutorials:

- Read on your own: [FATES documentation and user guide](https://fates-users-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). See especially the [FAQ](https://fates-users-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/faq.html) and this [slide deck from a 2019 tutorial](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kztSENcOOw54XpjDCebcOLWciC8kqJegkMJGnuQKisI/edit).
- Go to a course: CLM/CTSM course at NCAR in Boulder, Colorado (USA). See [this overview of tutorials](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/events/tutorials/). NCAR is the main development hub for the FATES and CLM models, and the Earth System Model CESM (which is similar to NorESM). 
- University 10 ETCS course in [Ecological Climatology](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/geofag/GEO5915/) at the University of Oslo, Norway. MSC and PhD level course taught by and for geoscience and biology. Some of the course teachers are involved in developing the NorESM-LSP, and from 2022 the course includes a 1-day data lab with the NorESM-LSP.
- [The NCAR-NEON collaboration](https://ncar.github.io/NEON-visualization/) (model-data integration project aimed at beginners, includes example code for visualization of output)
