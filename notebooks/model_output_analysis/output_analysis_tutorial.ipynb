You simply need to navigate to your output directory at the top (by default contained in `/resources/cases/your_case_id`) to load in the data.

    "After we have learned how to read the data and how to create output plots while taking the differences in variable dimensions into account, we now want to focus on explaining what we see. One notorious challenge when using earth system models is the computationally expensive **spin-up phase**. When choosing `runtype=startup` in the model settings, which is the NorESM-LSP default, we start the model from a so-called \"bare ground\" state: the simulation commences from bare soil without any vegetation and empty carbon pools (soil, litter, etc.). In the beginning, fast-growing pioneer PFTs like grasses or fast-growing trees may thrive, before they are outcompeted by other plants or die if the climate is unsuitable. Consequently, model results that did not undergo a sufficiently long spin-up period should usually be considered invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "The spin-up period computational load can be maneageable for single-site simulations, but it gets more difficult the larger the simulated area is and the more model components you include. In CLM-FATES, the starting conditions are chiefly controlled by the `runtype` parameter - depending on its value, additional files and parameter changes may be required. For example, it is also possible to use a previous spin-up simulation as a starting point for other modelling experiments, which is currently not implemented in the NorESM-LSP's GUI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create plots to investigate some important state variables over our chosen simulation period.\n",

    "If you used `runtype=startup` for your simulation, you should see that the values in the plots above start at an arbitrary value, fluctuate with the seasons, and commonly start increasing over several years. For sufficiently long periods they should stabilize over time: the vegetation and carbon pools reach an equilibrium state. The variables still fluctuate at equilibrium, driven by model processes such as disturbances and plant mortality, and by climatic variability in the forcing data, but the magnitudes and \"overall patterns\" do not change drastically anymore. Some state variables such as the soil carbon pool can take particularly long until they reach equilibrium due to the slow nature of the involved processes (decomposition, litter buildup, etc.). Reaching a steady state may take a long time, from hundreds to thousands of simulation years, especially in cold or dry climates where vegetation growth is slow."
